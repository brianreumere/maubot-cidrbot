# maubot-cidrbot

A Maubot plugin to get info about IP addresses in CIDR notation.

## Commands

- `!cidr 10.0.0.0/24` - Prints whether the given IP address is a network ID, broadcast address, or host address; how many host addresses are available in the subnet; the network ID and broadcast addresses; and if the address is a part of any special range (e.g., RFC 1918).
